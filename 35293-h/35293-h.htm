<h2>A DAY WITH BURNS.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><img class="left" src="images/dropt.jpg" height="100" alt="T" title="" />here are few figures which
appeal more picturesquely to the
imagination than that of the
ploughman-poet&mdash;swarthy, stalwart,
black-eyed,&mdash;striding along
the furrow in the grey of a
dreary dawn. Yet Burns was
far from being a mere uncultured peasant, nor
did he come of peasant stock. His forefathers
were small yeoman farmers, who had risked
themselves in the cause of the Young Pretender:
they had a certain amount of family pride
and family tradition. Robert Burns had been
educated in small schools, by various tutors, and
by his father, a man of considerable attainments.
He had acquired some French and Latin,
studied mensuration, and acquainted himself
with a good deal of poetry and many theological
and philosophical books.</p>

<p>So that the man who may be seen going
out this dusky morning from his little farmstead
of Ellisland near Dumfries&mdash;the dark and
taciturn man in hodden grey and rough top
boots&mdash;is not precisely a son of the soil. He is
a hard worker in the field by dint of necessity,
but his strenuous and impetuous mind is set
upon other thoughts than the plough, as he
drives his share along the Nithsdale uplands. It
is exactly the season of the year that he delights
in. "There is scarcely any earthly object,"
he has written, "which gives me more&mdash;I do
not know if I should call it pleasure, but something
that exalts me, something that enraptures
me&mdash;than to walk in the sheltered side of a
wood or high plantation on a cloudy winter's
day, and hear the stormy wind howling among
the trees, or raving over the plains&hellip;. I
take a peculiar pleasure in the season of winter,
more than the rest of the year&hellip;. There is
something that raises the mind to a serious
sublimity, favourable to everything great and
noble." And there is also something secretly
akin to the poet's wild and passionate soul. For
this is not a happy man, but an embittered one,
and ready to "rail on Lady Fortune in good
set terms." He takes the storm-wind for an
interpreter:</p>

<p>His brief meteoric reign of popularity in
Edinburgh is now at an end: from being a
popular idol of society, caressed and f&ecirc;ted,
he has been let to sink back into his native
obscurity. And, being poignantly proud,
he suffers accordingly. The consciousness of
genius burns within him, a flame that devours
rather than illumines: and he finds vent for his
bitterness, as he treads the clogging fallow, in
the immortal lines: <i>A Man's a Man for a' that</i>.</p>

<p>Presently, however, the sweet influences of
the clear air, the pleasant smell of upturned
earth, the wholesome sight and sounds of
morning, soothe the poet's rugged spirit: he
becomes attuned to the calmer present, and
forgetful of the feverish past. Burns has
never been given to depicting the shows and
forms of nature for their own sake: he only
uses them as a stage for the setting of a central
human interest. In short, he "cares little,"
it has been said, "for the natural picturesqueness
in itself: the moral picturesqueness touches
him more nearly." And all sentient life is dear
to him&mdash;not human life alone. Hence, one
sees him wince and shrink, as his ploughshare
destroys the daisy.</p>

<p>Or he becomes thoughtful and abstracted
beyond his wont, after turning up a mouse's
nest with the plough; and sternly recalls his
"gaudsman" or ploughboy, who would kill the
little creature out of pure thoughtlessness. He
muses upon the irony of fate: and the world is

<p>But nothing is too trivial to evade this large
and universal sympathy of his. "Not long ago,
one morning, as I was out in the fields sowing
some grass seeds, I heard the burst of a shot
from a neighbouring plantation, and presently a
poor little wounded hare came crippling by me.
You will guess my indignation at the inhuman
fellow who could shoot a hare at this season,
when they all of them have young ones." It is
on record that he threatened to throw the
culprit&mdash;a neighbouring farmer's son&mdash;into the
Nith to reward his inhumanity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ploughing is finished for the day, but
the poet must now needs betake himself to those
official duties as an exciseman, which are
perhaps even less congenial to him than agricultural
pursuits. He has to cover some two
hundred miles' riding every week; he is forced
to earn a scanty living for himself and his
family, by incessant physical and mental work.
The iron has entered into his soul&mdash;here and
there it crops up in hard metallic outbursts:
though for the most part, he is unrivalled in
spontaneous gaiety of song. And old sorrows
come upon him as he rides alone&hellip;. He
considers the present time to be the happiest
of his life. He has an excellent wife, and
bonnie bairns: friends many and faithful:
comparative immunity from financial troubles: a
popularity such as no other Scottish poet has
attained; yet memories of the past remain,
which are never to be obliterated in oblivion.
And chief among these is the greatest sorrow
that has befallen him&mdash;the loss of his one true
love, his cherished Highland Mary.</p>

<p>Burns has been an easy and inconstant
lover all his days: devoted, for the nonce, to
every girl he met. But Mary was on a pinnacle
apart&mdash;unequalled, irreplaceable; and still he is
continually dreaming of her&mdash;dreaming in
tender and melodious verse.</p>

<p>But now, hard upon the scent of smugglers
across the Nithsdale moors, exchanging cheery
greetings with cottagers here and there, the
tramp of his horse's hoofs inspires him to a gayer
measure. The clouds, which have overhung
his mind all the forenoon, roll away: and his
mercurial spirit seizes any pleasure that the
moment may afford. The nearest to hand is the
ready ripple of rhythm in light short songs that
fairly bubble over with gaiety. For there is
nothing of the midnight oil about Robert Burns&mdash;his
poems come swiftly and spontaneously to
him, as naturally as music to a blackbird: they
have indeed the same quality as the carols of
birds&mdash;careless, happy, tuneful. Any casual
impression sets our poet singing: the mere
glance of a merry blue eye at a window, and
he is away on the praises of one immediately
present lassie, or of innumerable others absent.</p>

<p>Presently he turns his horse's head towards
Dumfries. It is market-day in the town, and
a score of friends give him clamorous welcome.
They may not fully appreciate Rob's mental
equipments, but they greet him as the best of
good companions: and in a little while he forms
the leading spirit of some excited group, discussing
matters social and political. For Burns
takes the keenest interest in current events:
and, though most of his poems may be of a
more ephemeral interest, he is capable, when
deeply stirred, of expressing himself with a stern
and lofty patriotism. It may be inspired by
the events of the present: it often is evoked by
glories of the past.</p>

market-days are wearing late," the dour and
bitter looks of the poet are exchanged for
glowing eyes and laughing lips, while he recites
some of the lines which he has wedded to old
and familiar melodies. As Moore, a little later,
secured for the Irish airs a world-wide
reputation, by supplying them with words of a
more popular character than their own&mdash;so
Burns re-wrote the songs of his country.

<p>But now it is time that Burns, like his
hero, should take the homeward road. He
calls for his horse, parts from his boisterous
comrades, and rides out into the wintry evening.
Nithsdale is a land of lovely sunsets: and
against the rose and gold of heaven, the poet
sees the homely cottage-smoke of earth, thin
spirals of blue vapour, speaking of happy
hearths and labour ended. It is several years
since Burns, standing with Douglas Stewart
upon the Braid Hills, declared that to him the
worthiest object in the whole bright morning
landscape was the cluster of smoking cottages.
But still he regards them with affection
and enjoyment: and chiefly his eyes are bent
towards that quiet homestead which holds
his own dear folk. All the peace which that
stormy heart can find is set and centred there:
despite all previous fugitive fancies for Jessie,
and Peggie, and Phemie, and the rest, he has
found calm happiness with his Jean, the most
devoted of wives.</p>

<p>Now, in the quiet house, the man at last is
free to take up his pen. He is writing hard,
daily, or rather nightly: every week sees a
parcel of manuscript despatched to his publisher.
The thoughts which have crowded tumultuously
upon him all day long, may at last be set down
and conserved: for poetry, as Wordsworth
says, "is emotion remembered in tranquillity."
The grave and swarthy face bends above the
paper in the candlelight&mdash;varying expressions
chase each other across the mobile mouth and
eyes. Sometimes the theme is one of poignant
pathos.</p>

stop the flow of inspiration: it is not an unwelcome

after many years from foreign parts, has learned
of "Rob's" amazing leap into fame. Strangers,
drawn by curiosity and admiration, are not
infrequent visitors: "It was something to have
dined or supped in the company of Burns."
But this is a different matter: and the warm

<p>It is late, very late, when the visitor departs:
the stars are frosty, the ground hard. The
spell of newly-roused remembrances lies heavy
still upon Burns's heart: and as he turns to rest,
and sees the peaceful sleeping forms of his wife
and little children, tender and calm desires well
up within him. He can conceive no higher
happiness than comes of a serene old age, in
the company of those dear ones: and a picture
rises before him of old folk gently descending to
a longer rest, side by side together.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
